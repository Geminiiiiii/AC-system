# Project Title 项目名称

> Academic programs are crucial for a school's success in today's knowledge-focused society. They manage tasks such as course scheduling and attendance tracking. To efficiently handle these tasks, we developed a Java-based academic system using JSP for the webpage, Eclipse for programming, Tomcat10 as the server, and MySQL for data management.

Due to the large number of people in the current university and the complicated situation, a special system is needed to deal with school affairs. I have made an AC system. This AC system can view the background of the school and various humanities and cultures of the school on the home page. On the login page , Different identities can choose different login entries, students can check their grades or courses, teachers can also check, and administrators can manage student information.

## Getting Started 使用指南

The project develops the application functionality utilising the representation layer, business layer, and database layer of the Java EE 3-layer architecture. The three-tier structure, which is based on Java EE, is made up of the web browser, web server, and database server. The HTTP protocol enables two-way communication between the user's browser and the web server, which is the responsibility of the web server. A file management system is also installed on the server to store a significant amount of file data and allow access to the files at a specific location on the server in accordance with the platform's module classification. On a server running Windows, the file management system, web services, and database are all deployed simultaneously.
